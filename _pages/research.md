Building Trust: Blockchain-Enabled Smart Contracts for Decentralized and Autonomous Construction Management
------

Blockchain-enabled smart contracts represent a tremendous opportunity for enabling decentralized construction management by embedding predefined contractual clauses in smart contracts and integrating external verification mechanisms. Our research first focuses on formulating smart contract clauses to coordinate task assignments and payment distribution among subcontractors. To achieve this, a simulation model was employed to generate various “what-if” construction scenarios. Then, game theory principles were applied to form the equitable reward-penalty sharing contract clauses under different scenarios, ensuring fair compensation structures aligned with subcontractor performance. The second focus involves automating smart contract execution through the integration of as-built images and computer vision models, which function as blockchain oracles to assess project progress in real-time. Collectively, our work advances the development of a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) capable of managing construction activities with minimal centralized governance. Centralized project managers can delegate specific tasks to the system for automated execution.
