CHAT Lab is dedicated to autonomous technology applications on construction sites. We are interested in integrating human knowledge and prioritizing human-centric design for technology-empowered construction automation. We are particularly interested in the role of AI in this human-technology interaction (HTI) process. Currently, our research focus includes: (1) Human-Technology Interaction in the Construction Workplace; (2) Generative AI, Computing-Powered Construction Application; (3) Smart Contracts for Decentralized Construction Management.
